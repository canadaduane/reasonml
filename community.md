# Community

## ReasonML

ReasonML is new, so the community is still growing around it. Here are a few places to look for connections or help:

- The #reasonml channel on irc.freenode.net. You can see the [chat logs](http://irclog.whitequark.org/reasonml/) on the web. There's talk of creating a slack.com or gitter.im channel as well.
- The [/r/reasonml subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/reasonml).

### OCaml Community

Since ReasonML is so closely related to OCaml (it shares everything but the syntax in common--libraries, compiler, package manager, etc.) there's plenty of overlap with existing OCaml community resources:

- The [/r/ocaml subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/ocaml).
- The [caml-list](https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list) mailing list.
- The [OCaml Beginner's](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ocaml_beginners) mailing list.
