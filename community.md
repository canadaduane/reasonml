## [ReasonML](https://facebook.github.io/reason/)

ReasonML is quite new, so the community is still growing around it. Here are a few places to look for connections or help:

- The #reasonml channel on irc.freenode.net. You can see the [chat logs](http://irclog.whitequark.org/reasonml/) on the web. There's a [gitter.im channel](https://gitter.im/facebook/reason) as well.
- The [/r/reasonml subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/reasonml).

## [BuckleScript](https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript)

Since BuckleScript is a backend to OCaml, its author recommends discussing questions or ideas on the OCaml Beginners mailing list or caml-list, below.

## OCaml Community

Since ReasonML is so closely related to OCaml (it shares everything but the syntax in common--libraries, compiler, package manager, etc.), and BuckleScript is a backend to OCaml, there's plenty of overlap with existing OCaml community resources:

- The [/r/ocaml subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/ocaml).
- The [caml-list](https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list) mailing list.
- The [OCaml Beginners](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ocaml_beginners) mailing list.
