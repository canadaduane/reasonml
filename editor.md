# Setting Up Your Editor

ReasonML is a new syntax, but it has great support for several editors thanks to [Merlin](https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin).

To install Merlin, run:
```
opam install merlin
```

See [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for more info about `opam`.

## Sublime Text 3

The [Sublime Text Merlin](https://github.com/cynddl/sublime-text-merlin) plugin for Sublime Text 3 supports OCaml syntax.

**Installation:**

- in Sublime Text, press Cmd+Shift+P
- type in "Install" which should bring up the "Package Control: Install Package" option (NOTE: you need to have [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) installed)
- type "Merlin" to install the sublime-text-merlin package
